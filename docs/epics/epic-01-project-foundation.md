# Epic 1: Project Foundation & Development Environment

## Epic Goal
Establish the complete development foundation for the P2P Sandbox platform, including repository setup, development environment configuration, core technology stack initialization, and basic CI/CD pipeline to enable rapid feature development.

## Epic Description

### Overview
This epic focuses on creating a solid technical foundation for the P2P Sandbox for SMEs platform. It encompasses all the initial setup and configuration needed before implementing any business features, ensuring the development team has a properly configured, containerized environment with all core technologies integrated.

### Technical Scope
- Repository initialization with proper structure
- Frontend setup with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui
- Backend setup with Python, FastAPI, and RESTful API foundation
- Database configuration for PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- Authentication framework setup with SuperTokens
- Docker containerization for all services
- Basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Development environment documentation

### Success Criteria
- Developers can clone the repository and have a working environment within 15 minutes
- All services run successfully in Docker containers
- Basic "Hello World" endpoints work for both frontend and backend
- Authentication flow (registration/login) is functional
- CI/CD pipeline runs on every commit
- Development documentation is complete and accurate

### Story 6: Docker Containerization
**As a** developer  
**I want** all services containerized  
**So that** I can run the entire stack with one command

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dockerfile for frontend application
- [ ] Dockerfile for backend application
- [ ] docker-compose.yml orchestrating all services
- [ ] Volume mounts for development hot-reloading
- [ ] Network configuration for inter-service communication

- [ ] Automated linting for frontend and backend
- [ ] Unit test execution in CI pipeline
- [ ] Build verification for all components
- [ ] Docker image building and registry push
- [ ] Basic deployment workflow structure (to be expanded later)

## Technical Requirements

### Development Machine Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Python 3.11+
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Key Configuration Decisions
- **Port Assignments:**
  - Frontend: 3000
  - Backend API: 8000
  - PostgreSQL: 5432
  - MongoDB: 27017
  - SuperTokens: 3567

- **Container Names:**
  - p2p-frontend
  - p2p-backend
  - p2p-postgres
  - p2p-mongodb
  - p2p-supertokens

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- GitHub repository creation (User responsibility)
- Docker Hub account for image registry (User responsibility)
- Decision on cloud provider for future deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)

### Technical Decisions Needed

## Notes for Story Development

When developing the detailed stories, ensure each includes:
1. Clear technical specifications
2. Specific file paths and code examples where applicable
3. Testing requirements
4. Documentation requirements
5. Integration points with other stories

This epic lays the foundation for all future development. It should be completed before any feature development begins to ensure a stable, consistent development environment for the team.
