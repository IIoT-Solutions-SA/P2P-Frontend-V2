# Backend Development Status Summary

## Current Status (as of 2025-01-05)

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Phase 1: Backend Foundation
1. **P1.STRUCT.01 - Project Structure Setup**
   - Created complete FastAPI project structure
   - Organized into modules (models, apis, services, db, etc.)
   - Set up Python package configuration

2. **P1.FAST.01 - FastAPI Application Setup**
   - Implemented FastAPI main application with lifespan events
   - Configured CORS middleware
   - Added global exception handlers
   - Set up API versioning (v1)

3. **P1.CONFIG.01 - Configuration Management**
   - Implemented Pydantic Settings for environment management
   - Fixed CORS parsing issues (changed from List to string with property)
   - Added validation for all settings
   - Support for .env file loading

4. **P1.DB.01 - Database Connection Setup**
   - Implemented async PostgreSQL with AsyncPG
   - Set up MongoDB with Motor (not deprecated PyMongo async)
   - Created connection pooling for both databases
   - Added health check functions
   - Implemented dependency injection for database sessions

5. **P1.MODEL.01 - SQLModel Base Setup**
   - Created base models with UUID primary keys
   - Added timestamp mixins (created_at, updated_at)
   - Implemented soft delete functionality
   - Set up JSON encoders for special types

6. **P1.MODEL.02 - User and Organization Models**
   - Created comprehensive User model with all required fields
   - Created Organization model with business logic
   - Defined enums for roles, statuses, industries
   - Added relationships between models
   - Implemented permission checking methods

### üîß Fixed Issues

1. **Pydantic Settings CORS Parsing**
   - Changed List[str] field to string field with parsing property
   - Prevents JSON parsing errors for comma-separated values

2. **MongoDB Client Import**
   - Fixed import from deprecated PyMongo AsyncMongoClient
   - Now using Motor's AsyncIOMotorClient

3. **Docker Container Issues**
   - Documented troubleshooting steps
   - Created comprehensive debugging guide

### üìÅ Files Created/Modified

#### Models
- `/app/models/base.py` - Base model classes
- `/app/models/enums.py` - Enum definitions
- `/app/models/user.py` - User model
- `/app/models/organization.py` - Organization model
- `/app/models/__init__.py` - Model exports

#### Database
- `/app/db/session.py` - Database connections (fixed MongoDB import)

#### Configuration
- `/app/core/config.py` - Settings management (fixed CORS parsing)
- `/app/main.py` - Updated CORS configuration usage

#### Documentation
- `/docs/aadil_docs/docker-troubleshooting-guide.md` - Container troubleshooting
- `/docs/aadil_docs/backend-status-summary.md` - This file

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **P1.MIGRATE.01 - Set up Alembic**
   - Initialize Alembic for database migrations
   - Create initial migration for User and Organization tables
   - Test migration up/down

2. **P1.CRUD.01 - Base CRUD Operations**
   - Create generic CRUD base class
   - Implement pagination
   - Add filtering and sorting

3. **P1.HEALTH.01 - Health Check Endpoints**
   - Implement /health endpoint
   - Add database connectivity checks
   - Include version information

4. **P1.LOG.01 - Logging Configuration**
   - Set up structured logging
   - Configure log levels by environment
   - Add request ID tracking

### üê≥ Docker Container Status

To check if everything is running:

```bash
# Check all containers
docker-compose ps

# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# View logs
docker logs p2p-backend --tail 50
```

### üîç Known Issues

1. **SuperTokens Health Check**: Container health check disabled due to missing tools in container (curl/nc). Service works but health check fails.

2. **Backend Container Startup**: May fail due to environment variable parsing. See troubleshooting guide for solutions.

### üìä Progress Overview

- **Phase 0**: ‚úÖ Complete (Container Foundation)
- **Phase 0.5**: ‚úÖ Complete (Frontend Integration)
- **Phase 1**: 60% Complete (Backend Foundation)
  - Structure: ‚úÖ
  - FastAPI: ‚úÖ
  - Config: ‚úÖ
  - Database: ‚úÖ
  - Models: ‚úÖ
  - Migrations: ‚è≥ Pending
  - CRUD: ‚è≥ Pending
  - Health: ‚è≥ Pending
  - Logging: ‚è≥ Pending

### üí° Developer Notes

1. Always run `docker-compose ps` to check container status
2. Use `docker logs p2p-backend` to debug issues
3. The backend uses async/await throughout - maintain this pattern
4. All models use UUID primary keys for better distributed system support
5. Soft delete is implemented - use `is_deleted` flag instead of hard deletes

### üîó Important Commands

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Restart backend after code changes
docker-compose restart backend

# View backend logs
docker logs -f p2p-backend

# Access backend shell
docker exec -it p2p-backend /bin/bash

# Run tests (when implemented)
docker exec p2p-backend pytest
```
