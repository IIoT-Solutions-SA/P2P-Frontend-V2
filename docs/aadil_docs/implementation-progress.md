## Quick Notes

### Latest Update: 2025-01-04
- Completed Phase 0: Container Foundation
- All 5 services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SuperTokens, Backend) running in Docker
- Basic FastAPI app with health check endpoint working

### Next Steps:
- Phase 0.5: Frontend Integration Setup
- Install axios, react-query, and other frontend dependencies
- Create API service layer to connect frontend to backend

### Important Decisions:
- **KNOWN ISSUE - SuperTokens Health Check**: SuperTokens health check was disabled (changed from `service_healthy` to `service_started`) due to missing curl/nc tools in container. Service works correctly but health check fails. **TODO: Fix in future phase by implementing proper health check method.**
