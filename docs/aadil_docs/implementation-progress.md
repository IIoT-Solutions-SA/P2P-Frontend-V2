## Quick Notes

### Latest Update: 2025-01-05
- Completed Phase 1 Tasks: P1.STRUCT.01, P1.FAST.01, P1.CONFIG.01
- FastAPI project structure created with async support
- CORS configuration fixed and tested successfully
- All API endpoint placeholders created for future phases

### Next Steps:
- P1.DB.01: Set up async database connections (AsyncPG + Motor)
- P1.MODEL.01: Create SQLModel base classes
- P1.MODEL.02: Implement User and Organization models

### Important Decisions:
- **KNOWN ISSUE - SuperTokens Health Check**: SuperTokens health check was disabled (changed from `service_healthy` to `service_started`) due to missing curl/nc tools in container. Service works correctly but health check fails. **TODO: Fix in future phase by implementing proper health check method.**
