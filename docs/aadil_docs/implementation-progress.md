## Quick Notes

### Latest Update: 2025-01-05
- Completed Phase 1 Tasks: All except P1.LOG.01
- Fixed Docker container startup issues (CORS parsing, MongoDB imports, SQL execution)
- Implemented SQLModel base classes with UUID, timestamps, and soft delete
- Created comprehensive User and Organization models with all fields
- Set up Alembic with async support and created initial migration
- Implemented generic CRUD operations with organization filtering
- Created Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- Enhanced health check endpoints with timestamps and detailed status

### Next Steps:
- P1.LOG.01: Configure structured logging (low priority)
- Move to Phase 2: Authentication System with SuperTokens

### Important Decisions:
- **KNOWN ISSUE - SuperTokens Health Check**: SuperTokens health check was disabled (changed from `service_healthy` to `service_started`) due to missing curl/nc tools in container. Service works correctly but health check fails. **TODO: Fix in future phase by implementing proper health check method.**
