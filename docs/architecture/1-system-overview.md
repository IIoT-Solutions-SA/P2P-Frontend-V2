# 1. System Overview

The P2P Sandbox for SMEs is a secure, cloud-native collaboration platform that empowers Saudi Arabian industrial SMEs to exchange knowledge, showcase digital transformation use cases, and co-develop training initiatives. It enables verified users—factory owners, plant engineers, and operations managers—to share insights, solve problems, and access 4IR case studies within a trusted, community-driven environment.

The platform is architected as a modular full-stack web application, designed for scalability, extensibility, and rapid iteration. It follows a three-tier architecture:

- **Frontend (Presentation Layer)**: React + Vite-based, i18n-ready, optimized for desktop/mobile.
- **Backend (Business Logic Layer)**: FastAPI with SuperTokens for authentication.
- **Database & Storage (Persistence Layer)**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and S3-compatible object storage.
