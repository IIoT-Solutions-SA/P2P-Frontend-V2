  - [ ] Add usage analytics dashboard

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the system architecture document, this story extends the **Use Case Library** component (#4) which handles "Structured case studies with filters, bookmarks, feedback, and geolocation for map display."

### Core Data Models Reference
The architecture defines a base UseCase model:
```
UseCase: id, submitted_by, title, problem_statement, solution_description, vendor_info, cost_estimate, impact_metrics, industry_tags, region, location {lat, lng}, bookmarks, published, featured
```

This story significantly extends this model with search, analytics, and user interaction capabilities.

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI with MongoDB for flexible use case document storage
- **Database**: MongoDB with full-text search indexes and aggregation pipelines
- **Frontend**: React + Vite with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Search**: MongoDB text indexes with custom relevance scoring

### Key Technical Requirements
1. **Search Performance**: Implement efficient MongoDB indexes for search and filtering operations
2. **Multilingual Support**: Handle Arabic/English content with proper text normalization
3. **Export Generation**: PDF/CSV export functionality for use case collections
4. **Real-time Analytics**: Track user interactions for trending and recommendation algorithms

### Dependencies
- Story 3.1 (Use Case Submission Tool) must be completed for base UseCase model
- Epic 2 Search System provides foundation search infrastructure
- File sharing system for attachment handling
- User authentication for bookmarking and analytics

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `/tests/use_case_library/`
- **Test Framework**: pytest for backend, Jest/React Testing Library for frontend
- **Testing Patterns**: 
  - Unit tests for search algorithms and relevance scoring
  - Integration tests for MongoDB aggregation pipelines
  - API endpoint tests for all library functionality
  - Frontend component tests for search interface
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Performance testing for search with large datasets (>10,000 use cases)
  - Multilingual search testing with Arabic and English content
  - Export functionality testing for PDF and CSV generation
  - Analytics tracking accuracy testing
