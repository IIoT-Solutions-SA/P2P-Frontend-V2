## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Dependencies
```text
# PostgreSQL Async Stack
sqlalchemy==2.0.25
asyncpg==0.29.0  
alembic==1.13.1

# MongoDB Async Stack  
motor==3.3.2
pymongo==4.6.0  # Pinned for compatibility
beanie==1.24.0

# Async Framework Support

```

### Connection Configuration
```python
# PostgreSQL Connection Pool Settings
pool_size=20              # Base connection pool size
max_overflow=40          # Additional connections under load  
pool_pre_ping=True       # Validate connections before use

```

### Implementation Challenges & Resolutions

#### Challenge 1: Motor/PyMongo Version Compatibility
- **Issue**: `ImportError: cannot import name '_QUERY_OPTIONS' from 'pymongo.cursor'`
- **Root Cause**: Motor 3.3.2 incompatible with latest PyMongo version
- **Resolution**: Pinned `pymongo==4.6.0` in requirements.txt for compatibility
- **Verification**: All imports and database connections working correctly

#### Challenge 2: Alembic Directory Conflicts  
- **Issue**: `FAILED: Directory alembic already exists and is not empty`
- **Root Cause**: Manual creation of Alembic configuration files before initialization
- **Resolution**: Skipped `alembic init` and proceeded directly to migration generation
- **Result**: Migration system fully operational with custom async configuration

#### Challenge 3: Black Formatter Missing
- **Issue**: `Could not find entrypoint console_scripts.black` during migration
- **Impact**: Non-critical formatting error, migration completed successfully
- **Resolution**: Migration files generated correctly despite formatter warning
- **Status**: Functional migration system, formatter optional for development

#### Challenge 4: PostgreSQL/MongoDB Role Synchronization
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL users created with "user" role while MongoDB had "admin"/"member" roles
- **Root Cause**: `UserService.create_user_pg()` method missing role parameter support
- **Resolution**: Updated service method to accept and apply role parameter consistently
- **Implementation**: Added role cleanup logic to maintain data consistency
- **Result**: Perfect role synchronization across both database systems

#### Challenge 5: Forum Post Model Field Mismatch
- **Issue**: `"ForumPost" object has no field "views"` during seed data creation
- **Root Cause**: Seed script trying to set fields not defined in ForumPost model
- **Resolution**: Extended ForumPost model with missing frontend-compatible fields
- **Added Fields**: `views`, `upvotes`, `is_pinned`, `has_best_answer`
- **Result**: Full frontend-backend data model consistency

#### Challenge 6: Forum Post Duplication
- **Issue**: Multiple runs of seed script created duplicate forum posts
- **Root Cause**: No cleanup or deduplication logic for forum data
- **Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive cleanup system before seeding
- **Features**: `ForumPost.delete_all()` and `ForumReply.delete_all()` for fresh starts
- **Result**: Clean, non-duplicated data on every seed run

## Database Container Commands

### PostgreSQL Container
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name p2p-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=p2p_sandbox \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=p2p_user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=iiot123 \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16-alpine
```

### MongoDB Container  
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name p2p-mongodb \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=p2p_user \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=iiot123 \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=p2p_sandbox \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  mongo:7
```
